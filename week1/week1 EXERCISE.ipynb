       "Certainly! The provided Python code defines a class called `SysToAsm` that is responsible for converting system definitions from a specified input file (in `.mdl` format) into assembly files. Hereâ€™s a summary of its components and functionality:\n",
       "\n",
       "### Class Overview: `SysToAsm`\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**:\n",
       "    - Initializes utility functions, assembly file creation helpers, and model system helpers. These are likely imported from other modules (not shown).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Destructor (`__del__` method)**:\n",
       "    - A placeholder for cleanup tasks when the object is destroyed.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Method: `nu_convert_system_to_assemblies`**:\n",
       "    - Converts a single system definition into assembly files.\n",
       "    - Extracts system definitions and arguments from provided system information.\n",
       "    - Prepares output paths for defining and data files based on the system name.\n",
       "    - Uses regular expressions to identify specific system definitions that should be processed.\n",
       "    - Collects assembly definitions and data for the systems, appending any additional dataset blocks as needed.\n",
       "    - Writes the resulting assembly content to specified output files.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Method: `execute_sys_2_asm`**:\n",
       "    - Main method to handle the conversion of all systems defined in the input `.mdl` file.\n",
       "    - Reads the input file, creating necessary directories for output.\n",
       "    - Extracts system and define blocks from the input content.\n",
       "    - Collects necessary data such as datasets, graphics, forms, and templates to build the assembly definitions.\n",
       "    - Calls `nu_convert_system_to_assemblies` for each system defined in the input file.\n",
       "    - Updates the input file content to reflect the changes, then writes this updated content to an output file.\n",
       "    - Prints a confirmation message after the conversion process is completed.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Key Processing Steps:\n",
       "- **File Handling**: The code ensures that the input is read and output directories are created.\n",
       "- **Regex Matching**: Utilizes regex to locate and manipulate specific parts of the system definitions.\n",
       "- **Data Extraction**: Gathers various blocks of definitions from the input, which are later used in assembly.\n",
       "- **Output Generation**: Creates two output files: one for assembly definitions and another for data.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Usage:\n",
       "At the end of the file, there is a specified path to an example input file and an output directory. The instance of `SysToAsm` is created and the conversion process is executed.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion:\n",
       "The `SysToAsm` class is geared towards processing system definitions in the context of assembly file creation, following a structured approach to organizing and appending various components while ensuring the input is correctly handled. The class would be useful in a scenario where systems defined in a model need to be converted for simulation, assembly, or other purposes."
